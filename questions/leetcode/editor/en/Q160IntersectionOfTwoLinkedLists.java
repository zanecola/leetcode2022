//Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node 
//at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at 
//all, return null. 
//
// For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node c1: 
// 
// The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the 
//entire linked structure. 
//
// Note that the linked lists must retain their original structure after the 
//function returns. 
//
// Custom Judge: 
//
// The inputs to the judge are given as follows (your program is not given 
//these inputs): 
//
// 
// intersectVal - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is 0
// if there is no intersected node. 
// listA - The first linked list. 
// listB - The second linked list. 
// skipA - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listA (starting from the head) 
//to get to the intersected node. 
// skipB - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listB (starting from the head) 
//to get to the intersected node. 
// 
//
// The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and 
//pass the two heads, headA and headB to your program. If you correctly return the 
//intersected node, then your solution will be accepted. 
//
// 
// Example 1: 
// 
// 
//Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2
//, skipB = 3
//Output: Intersected at '8'
//Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 
//if the two lists intersect).
//From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [
//5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 
//nodes before the intersected node in B.
//- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with 
//value 1 in A and B (2‚Åø·µà node in A and 3 ≥·µà node in B) are different node references. 
//In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes 
//with value 8 in A and B (3 ≥·µà node in A and 4·µó ∞ node in B) point to the same 
//location in memory.
// 
//
// Example 2: 
// 
// 
//Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, 
//skipB = 1
//Output: Intersected at '2'
//Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 
//if the two lists intersect).
//From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [
//3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node 
//before the intersected node in B.
// 
//
// Example 3: 
// 
// 
//Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
//Output: No intersection
//Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it 
//reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, 
//while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
//Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
// 
//
// 
// Constraints: 
//
// 
// The number of nodes of listA is in the m. 
// The number of nodes of listB is in the n. 
// 1 <= m, n <= 3 * 10‚Å¥ 
// 1 <= Node.val <= 10‚Åµ 
// 0 <= skipA < m 
// 0 <= skipB < n 
// intersectVal is 0 if listA and listB do not intersect. 
// intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB] if listA and listB intersect. 
// 
//
// 
//Follow up: Could you write a solution that runs in 
//O(m + n) time and use only 
//O(1) memory?
